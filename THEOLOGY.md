# Master Bible Study - Theological Framework

Master Bible Study (MBS) is a study of the Master of the Universe, God himself, based on three fundamental truths:

## Foundational Truths

1. **The Bible is the perfect word of God**, authored by God through the hands of men.

2. **Interpretation is best approached internally**, using the Bible's own definitions developed across its books.

3. **MBS draws specific conclusions concerning salvation for all of mankind.** All lessons support these conclusions: One obtains the guarantee of eternal life by participating in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through faith and water baptism by immersion as the gate, and then maintains spiritual life through participation in the spiritual food made available by His body.

## Using This Framework

When using MBS presentations or content:

- **Attribution:** Reference these foundational truths when presenting MBS conclusions, so others understand the framework behind the interpretations.

- **Modifications:** If you disagree with or reinterpret based on different foundations, clearly indicate what you've changed and why. This allows your version to be distinguished from the original framework.

- **Omissions:** The specific axioms listed above are essential to MBS conclusions. If you omit or alter these foundations, the conclusions may not follow logically. Be explicit about any changes.

## Why This Matters

Many theological interpretations achieve different conclusions by omitting or redefining foundational assumptions. MBS explicitly states its foundations so that:

1. Others can understand *why* MBS reaches its specific conclusions
2. Disagreements can be traced to foundational assumptions rather than interpretive methods
3. Your original source can be compared against modifications
4. The integrity of the theological framework is preserved
