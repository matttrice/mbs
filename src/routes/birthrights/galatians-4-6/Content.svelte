	Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba, Father." 7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir. 8 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. 9 But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?

	God knows his children because he put his Spirit in them. We know God in the same manner. In this way both the father and the son both "know" one another in harmony with the Holy Spirit that connects them. Any doctrine that results in less does not produce Sons of God / Abraham's seed and thus these fall into the category of those who Jesus never knew. Matthew 7:21.
