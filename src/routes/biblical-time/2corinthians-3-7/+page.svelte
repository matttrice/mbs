						Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was, <sup>8</sup> will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? <sup>9</sup> If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness! <sup>10</sup> For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. <sup>11</sup> And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!
