	"But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus at about noon, a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me, [7] and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?' [8] And I answered, 'Who are You, Lord?' And He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.' [9] And those who were with me saw the light, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me."
