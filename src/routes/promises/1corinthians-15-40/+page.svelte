					So it is with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is <em>perishable</em>, what is raised is <strong class="text-level3">imperishable</strong>. It is sown in <em>dishonor</em>, it is raised in <strong class="text-level3">glory</strong>. It is sown in <em>weakness</em>, it is raised in <strong class="text-level3">power</strong>. It is sown a <em>physical body</em>, it is raised a <strong class="text-level3">spiritual body</strong>. If there is a <em>physical body</em>, there is also a <strong class="text-level3">spiritual body</strong>. Thus it is written, "The <em>first man, Adam</em>, became a <em>living being</em>"; the <strong class="text-level3" style="text-decoration: underline">last Adam</strong> became a <strong class="text-level3" style="text-decoration: underline">life-giving spirit</strong>. But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the <em>earth</em>, a man of dust; the second man is from <strong class="text-level3">heaven</strong>.
