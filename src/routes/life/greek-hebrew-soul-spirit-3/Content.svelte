	<b>Psyche:</b> The New Testament uses may be analyzed approximately as follows: The language of Hebrews 4:12 suggests the extreme difficulty of distinguishing between the soul and the spirit, alike in their nature and in their activities.

	<b>Hebrews 4:12:</b> For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.<br/><br/>

	<b>Matthew 10:28</b> "And do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.<br/><br/>
	<b>Matthew 16:26</b> "For what will a man be profited, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?<br/><br/>
	<b>James 5:20</b> let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death...<br/><br/>
	<b>Acts 2:27</b> Because Thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades...<br/><br/>
	<b>Revelation 6:9</b> And when He broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God...
